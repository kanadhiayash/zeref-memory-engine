# gstack — reference-only import

## Origin

gstack is a global-scope skill collection registered on the user's Claude Code harness under `~/.claude/skills/`. Skills include `browse`, `qa`, `review`, `ship`, `land-and-deploy`, `design-*`, `plan-*`, `investigate`, `benchmark`, `document-*`, `learn`, and 30+ others.

## Boundary

This directory contains **no** vendored gstack source. Zeref invokes gstack skills through the host harness's global skill registry only. gstack skills may **not** write to `memory/`, `zeref/`, `benchmarks/`, or any Zeref-canonical surface.

## Why reference-only

- License provenance across gstack skills is unverified.
- Vendoring would leak internal skill authoring conventions into a public repo.
- `benchmarks/foreign_code_containment.py` stays trivially green when nothing is copied.
- gstack's own update cadence is out-of-band from Zeref's release cycle.

## Allowed use inside Zeref sessions

- Invocation via user or via a Zeref command that delegates (e.g. `/browse`, `/review`).
- Read of gstack skill output as untrusted input — subject to the same privacy scrub as any external tool result.

## Forbidden

- Copying gstack skill files into this repo.
- Executing gstack skills that write outside session scratch.
- Passing raw Zeref memory content to gstack tools without `privacy-abstraction` first.

## Council pack membership

gstack is registered in [team-packs/faang-mangoes-council.md](../../../team-packs/faang-mangoes-council.md) as a support surface for the Documentation Archaeologist and Runtime Auditor roles.
