# wiki-maintenance

## Mission

Keep flat `memory/` clean, indexed, and useful.

## Operations

### POST-WRITE (called by memory-keeper after every write)
1. Update `memory/index.md` row for the affected domain
2. If page > 1500 lines → propose archival to `memory/archive/`
3. Re-grade entries via `evidence-curator` if staleness threshold crossed

### CONSOLIDATE (on /done or explicit request)
1. Scan all wiki pages (`memory/index.md`, `memory/DECISIONS.md`, `memory/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`, `memory/RISKS.md`, `memory/CONFLICTS.md`)
2. Merge duplicate decisions
3. Move resolved questions to `memory/DECISIONS.md`
4. Archive items > 90 days old to `memory/archive/` (never hard delete per D9)
5. Rewrite `memory/index.md` summaries
6. Refresh `memory/hot.md` from last 3 session entries in `memory/patterns/PATTERNS.jsonl` (≤500 words per §0)

### LINT (on demand)
1. Check format compliance on all wiki pages
2. Report broken cross-references
3. Report orphaned domains (in `memory/index.md` but no page)

## Safety

- All writes via `memory-keeper`
- Archive moves are non-destructive (copy + mark superseded, never delete per D9)
- Respect `PRIVACY.md` mode on every consolidation rewrite
