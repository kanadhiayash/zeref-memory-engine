# project-setup

## Mission

Convert any user's messy project goal into structured config in one conversation. Conversational, not formal.

If the user cancels mid-interview, Zeref OS boots in READ-ONLY mode until the schema is complete (per ZEREF_OS §7).

## Interview

Ask these in natural language flow, not as a numbered form. Order roughly project → privacy → operations.

### Project (§7)
1. What is this project trying to achieve? (1–2 sentences)
2. What decisions will be made here that you need to remember later?
3. Who else will read this wiki — just you, or a team?
4. What does "done" look like for this project?

### Privacy (§4.2 verbatim)
5. Is this project personal, client, employer, or public?
6. What categories of data are sensitive? *(see REDACT.md classes — credentials, PII, internal_paths, client_data, financial, proprietary_code)*
7. Should Zeref OS store exact facts, abstractions only, or both? *(maps to PRIVACY.md mode: exact / abstract / local-only — default is **abstract**)*
8. Can any connected MCP tool read this project context, or must this wiki remain local-only? *(maps to SHARING_POLICY.md)*

On question 6, Zeref OS says (verbatim per §7):
> "You can describe the shape of the decision without sharing the data. Zeref OS will record the structure, not the content."

### Operations
9. Is there a parent project? (for rollup → `config/PARENT_SYNC.md`)
10. What model tier are you using? (Free / Standard / God Mode — auto-detected if possible per `config/BUDGET.md`)
11. What tools / MCP servers are in play? (Recommend leaving OFF; enable per-connector in `SHARING_POLICY.md`.)
12. Anything else memory should hold from day one?

## Output

Write or update these files. Each gets YAML frontmatter from the answers + a markdown body the user can hand-edit later.

| File | Source questions |
|---|---|
| `config/PROJECT.md` | 1–4, 12 |
| `PRIVACY.md` (root) | 5, 7 (mode), 6 (enabled classes mapping) |
| `REDACT.md` (root) | 6 (enable matching classes) |
| `SHARING_POLICY.md` (root) | 8, 11 |
| `config/PERMISSIONS.md` | defaults; ask if user wants overrides |
| `config/PARENT_SYNC.md` | 9 (enabled only if yes) |
| `config/BUDGET.md` | 10 |

After writing, confirm:
> "Wrote config to: `config/PROJECT.md`, root `PRIVACY.md`, `REDACT.md`, `SHARING_POLICY.md`, `config/PERMISSIONS.md`, `config/PARENT_SYNC.md`, `config/BUDGET.md`. Verify they look right. Run `/start` again to boot the session."

## Safety

- All writes go through `memory-keeper` → `privacy-guardian`
- If user declines to answer a question, leave the field empty with a `# TODO` marker — never invent
- If user cancels before privacy questions are answered, Zeref OS refuses to boot until they are. Privacy is non-negotiable per §4.
