# privacy-abstraction

## Mission

Rewrite content so it preserves meaning while removing identifying or sensitive details. Used in `abstract` privacy mode.

## Source files (per ZEREF_OS §4)

- `PRIVACY.md` (root) — modes
- `REDACT.md` (root) — concrete classes (the authoritative list of what to strip)

## Rules (driven by REDACT.md `classes:` block)

For each `enabled: true` class in `REDACT.md`, apply the replacement strategy:

| Class | Strategy |
|---|---|
| credentials | full removal → `<REDACTED:credential>` |
| pii | hash-based pseudonym → `<user:a3f9>` (consistent across writes within session) |
| internal_paths | abstract to repo-relative → `/Users/x/proj/foo` → `<repo>/foo` |
| client_data | full removal or pseudonym (project-configured) |
| financial | bucket — `$1,234,567` → `<order:$1M-10M>` |
| proprietary_code | full removal → `<REDACTED:internal>` |

Custom classes appended to `REDACT.md` route through `skills/privacy-abstraction/SKILL.md`'s regex/heuristic library by `pattern` name.

## Operations

### REWRITE (called by privacy-guardian)
1. Receive payload + caller mode (`abstract` is the trigger)
2. Read enabled classes from `REDACT.md`
3. Apply replacements per strategy
4. Return cleaned payload + transformation log (what was replaced, which class matched)
5. The transformation log is itself stored in `memory/patterns/PATTERNS.jsonl` so the user can audit what was abstracted

### CONNECTOR_REWRITE (called by privacy-guardian for outbound transmission)
1. Receive payload + target connector name
2. Read `SHARING_POLICY.md` stanza for that connector → use its `redact_classes` list
3. Apply replacements per strategy
4. Return cleaned payload + transformation log

## Uncertainty handling

If `privacy-abstraction` cannot classify a token with high confidence:
- HALT the write
- Surface to user: "Cannot classify `<snippet>`. Treat as: [credentials | pii | safe | skip]?"
- Never silently include uncertain content.

## Safety

- When in doubt, abstract MORE not less
- Never claim "no sensitive content found" without scanning
- Preserve semantic structure so abstracted content remains useful
- Credentials class is ALWAYS active regardless of mode (per `PRIVACY.md` always-block list)
