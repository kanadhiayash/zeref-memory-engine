description: Enforces privacy mode on every write to memory/ and every external transmission. Reads root PRIVACY.md to determine mode, REDACT.md for sensitive classes, SHARING_POLICY.md for connector allowlist. In abstract mode, invokes privacy-abstraction skill before write. In local-only mode, blocks writes to memory/sync/outbound/ and memory/sync/parent/.

# privacy-guardian

## Mission

Prevent accidental leakage of sensitive project data through AI use. Every write to `memory/` and every external transmission passes through this guardian.

## Source files (per ZEREF_OS §4)

- `PRIVACY.md` (root) — modes and global policy
- `REDACT.md` (root) — concrete sensitive classes
- `SHARING_POLICY.md` (root) — per-connector allowlist

## Modes (from PRIVACY.md frontmatter)

### exact
Pass through unchanged. Permitted only when user explicitly enables per project.

### abstract *(default per §4.3)*
Invoke `privacy-abstraction` skill to rewrite payload, walking each `enabled: true` class in `REDACT.md`:
- credentials → full removal `<REDACTED:credential>`
- pii → hash-based pseudonym `<user:a3f9>`
- internal_paths → repo-relative
- client_data / financial / proprietary_code → as configured per project

### local-only
- Allow writes to `memory/index.md`, `memory/DECISIONS.md`, `memory/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`, `memory/RISKS.md`, `memory/CONFLICTS.md`, `memory/MEMORY.md`, `memory/hot.md`, `memory/patterns/PATTERNS.jsonl`, `memory/snapshots/`, `memory/archive/`, `memory/raw/`
- BLOCK writes to `memory/sync/outbound/` and `memory/sync/parent/`
- Log block event: `{"event": "privacy-block", "target": "...", "reason": "local-only mode"}`

## Always-block (regardless of mode)

- Credentials of any form (per `REDACT.md` credentials class — always enabled)
- Contents of `.gitignore`-matched files
- Raw clipboard contents unless explicitly captured to `memory/raw/`
- Anything matched by enabled classes in `REDACT.md`

## Connector gating (per SHARING_POLICY.md)

Before any external transmission via an MCP connector:
1. Read connector's stanza in `SHARING_POLICY.md`
2. If `enabled: false` → reject + log
3. If `read_project_context: false` and the transmission includes wiki content → reject + log
4. If `write_external: false` and the action is an external write → require per-action user approval
5. Run payload through every `redact_classes` entry listed for that connector
6. Log: `{"event": "connector-send", "connector": "...", "target": "...", "redacted_classes": [...]}`

## Operations

### CHECK (called by memory-keeper before write)
1. Read current mode from `PRIVACY.md`
2. Scan payload for always-block patterns → reject + log if found
3. If mode = abstract → invoke `privacy-abstraction` skill with `REDACT.md` classes
4. If mode = local-only and target in `local_only_blocks` → reject + log
5. Return cleaned payload (or rejection)

### EXTERNAL (called before any connector transmission)
1. Read `SHARING_POLICY.md` for the target connector
2. Apply gating rules above
3. Run `privacy-abstraction` over outbound payload using connector's `redact_classes`
4. Return cleaned payload or rejection

## Safety

- Bias toward false positives: when in doubt, block and ask user
- Never silently rewrite without logging the transformation
- Connector access is OFF by default — every enablement must be explicit in `SHARING_POLICY.md`
- Per-action approval required for external writes even when connector is enabled
