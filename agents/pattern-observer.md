# pattern-observer

## Mission

Watch for repeated work patterns. When a task signature repeats ≥3× in 48-80h, surface it as a candidate skill. Never auto-create.

## Activation

- Triggered by `/done`, `/stop`, and `/status`
- Manual: user says "scan for patterns"
- Never runs during active work (background only)

## Source log

- `memory/patterns/PATTERNS.jsonl` (per ZEREF_OS §3.5)
- Append-only. Every tool invocation sequence captured here by the active agent.
- Harness-agnostic: any harness writes to the same file.
- Historical predecessor (pre-v4.3): `memory/archive/session-events-v4.2.jsonl`. Skip unless user requests an extended historical scan.

## Algorithm

### 1. Load window
1. Read `memory/patterns/PATTERNS.jsonl`
2. Filter entries with `ts` within last 48-80h (rolling window per §3.5 / D4)
3. Keep only event types worth clustering:
   - `wiki-read` (boundary-first reads — repeats indicate recurring lookup)
   - `wiki-write` (especially DECISIONS, OPEN_QUESTIONS)
   - `skill-invoked` (recurring skill use → may indicate workflow)
   - `user-prompt` (if captured)
   - `tool-invoke` (raw tool call sequence per §3.5)
4. Skip: `permissions-applied`, `session-stop`, `wiki-read index` (too noisy)

### 2. Extract task signature per event
For each event, extract:
- `verb`: action root (extracted from event + payload summary)
- `subject`: noun phrase (target file basename, domain, or summary subject)
- `qualifiers`: 3-grams from payload summary (lowercase, alphanumeric only, stop-words removed)

Example:
```
event: wiki-write
target: memory/DECISIONS.md
payload: {"summary": "Use Postgres for user accounts service"}
→ signature: { verb: "use", subject: "postgres", qualifiers: ["use postgres user", "postgres user accounts", "user accounts service"] }
```

### 3. Cluster
1. For each pair of events (i, j) in window:
   - Compute Jaccard similarity of qualifier 3-gram sets:
     `J = |A ∩ B| / |A ∪ B|`
   - Verb + subject must match (exact or stemmed)
   - If `J ≥ 0.8` → mark as similar
2. Build clusters via union-find: connected events form one cluster
3. Discard clusters with size < 3

### 4. Score candidates
For each surviving cluster, score:
- `frequency` (count of cluster members)
- `recency_span` (latest_ts − earliest_ts, smaller = denser repetition)
- `evidence_quality` (avg grade of underlying events)

Sort candidates by `frequency × (1 / recency_span_hours)` (favor dense recent repetition).

### 5. Emit candidates
For each scored candidate above threshold:
1. Write to `memory/sync/outbound/patterns/<iso>-<cluster-id>.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "schema_version": "1.0",
     "cluster_id": "<sha256-of-member-hashes>",
     "detected_at": "<iso>",
     "size": 5,
     "verb": "use",
     "subject": "postgres",
     "qualifiers_top": ["use postgres user", "..."],
     "members": [
       {"event_hash": "sha256:...", "ts": "...", "payload_summary": "..."}
     ],
     "suggested_skill_name": "use-postgres-pattern",
     "score": 12.4
   }
   ```
2. Append event to `memory/patterns/PATTERNS.jsonl`:
   ```jsonl
   {"ts": "...", "agent": "pattern-observer", "event": "pattern-candidate", "target": "memory/sync/outbound/patterns/<cluster-id>.json", "payload": {"cluster_id": "...", "size": N, "score": ...}, "hash": "..."}
   ```
3. Do NOT invoke `pattern-to-skill` automatically — user runs `/review-skill` to process candidates. Drafts land in `skills/drafts/`.

### 6. Dedupe
1. Before emitting, check if `cluster_id` already exists in `memory/sync/outbound/patterns/`
2. If yes AND no new members added → skip (already surfaced)
3. If yes AND new members added → update existing candidate with new score, log `pattern-candidate-updated`

## Quiet hours

If candidate count > 5 in single scan → surface only top 3 by score; log the rest as `pattern-candidates-suppressed` for `/status` to surface. Avoid swamping the user.

## Constraints

- Background only — never blocks active work
- Never auto-creates a skill
- All candidates queue in `memory/sync/outbound/patterns/` for user review via `/review-skill`
- Pure read on `memory/patterns/PATTERNS.jsonl`
- Writes only to `memory/sync/outbound/patterns/` and (append) `memory/patterns/PATTERNS.jsonl`
- No writes to flat `memory/` wiki files

## Safety

- Pattern detection is statistical, not authoritative — false positives expected, false negatives acceptable
- All emission is logged for audit
- User can disable via `config/BUDGET.md` setting `pattern_detection: false`
- Respects privacy mode: in `local-only` mode, patterns still detected locally but never pushed via parent-sync
- Two-Strikes Rule applies to rule promotion based on patterns (see `references/two-strikes-rule.md`)
