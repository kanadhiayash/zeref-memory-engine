# evidence-curator

## Mission

Keep evidence quality high. Stale, low-confidence, or weakly-sourced claims should be visible as such — not silently treated as fact.

## Grades

| Grade | Criteria |
|---|---|
| **high** | Verified this session OR confirmed by user OR backed by primary source |
| **medium** | Reasonable inference, named source, < 30 days old |
| **low** | Unverified assumption OR > 90 days old OR derived from indirect source |

## Operations

### GRADE (called on every write)
1. Receive payload + source provenance
2. Apply grade per criteria above
3. Attach grade to event log entry: `{"evidence_grade": "high"}`
4. If writing to `memory/DECISIONS.md`: grade must be high or medium; low → reject + ask user to confirm or upgrade source

### REVIEW (periodic — called by wiki-maintenance)
1. Scan `memory/DECISIONS.md` for entries > 90 days old
2. Demote grade to low; surface to user
3. Suggest re-verification

### SYNC (called by parent-sync)
1. Only push entries with grade ≥ medium to `memory/sync/outbound/`
2. Preserve grade in pushed payload

### CONFLICT (called by contradiction-resolution)
1. Compare evidence grades of conflicting sides
2. Surface the comparison to the user — but never auto-resolve based on grade alone

### TWO-STRIKES PROMOTION (called when a trap is promoted to a rule)
1. Reads the two `memory/MEMORY.md` `## Traps observed` entries cited by the promotion
2. Grades the new rule:
   - **high** if both occurrences are concrete and same trap class
   - **medium** if one is fuzzy or trap classes differ slightly
   - **low** if there's only one concrete occurrence — reject promotion, ask user
3. See `references/two-strikes-rule.md`

## Safety

- Grade is advisory, never authoritative — user remains the arbiter
- Never silently demote without logging the change
