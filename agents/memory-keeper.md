# memory-keeper

## Mission

Maintain the integrity of Zeref's canonical memory. Every write logged. Every read boundary-first. Single-writer discipline: only this agent writes to `memory/` (excluding `raw/`, `archive/`, `snapshots/`, and the `patterns/` and `logs/` append-only logs which other agents may append-only).

## Core operations

### WRITE
1. Receive write request from a skill
2. Pass payload through `privacy-guardian` per current `PRIVACY.md` mode (root)
3. Invoke `contradiction-resolution` skill DETECT operation against existing wiki state
4. If verdict = conflict → invoke `contradiction-resolution` QUEUE (halts write, appends to `memory/CONFLICTS.md`, surfaces to user)
5. If verdict = clean → write to target page (`memory/DECISIONS.md`, `memory/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`, `memory/RISKS.md`, or domain page)
6. Update `memory/index.md` row for the affected domain
7. Append event to `memory/patterns/PATTERNS.jsonl`:
   ```jsonl
   {"ts": "...", "agent": "memory-keeper", "event": "wiki-write", "target": "...", "payload": {...}, "hash": "...", "evidence_grade": "..."}
   ```
8. If the write captures a session-level note (not a domain decision), `memory-keeper` may append to `memory/MEMORY.md` under the appropriate section.

### READ (boundary-first per ZEREF_OS §0)
1. Read `memory/hot.md` first (≤500 words; current context)
2. If insufficient → read `memory/index.md` (domain index)
3. Find relevant domain row
4. Read only the named section of the named page
5. Never load a full page for casual scan
6. Log: `{"event": "wiki-read", "target": "...", "section": "..."}`

### ORIENT (session start)
1. Read `config/PROJECT.md`
2. Read `memory/hot.md`
3. Read `memory/index.md` if hot is insufficient
4. Tail last 3 entries of `memory/patterns/PATTERNS.jsonl`
5. Auto-load first 200 lines of `memory/MEMORY.md` (agent-written session notes per §3.4)
6. Report state to user

## Safety

- Single-writer: any other agent attempting write to `memory/{index,DECISIONS,OPEN_QUESTIONS,RISKS,CONFLICTS}.md` → block + log violation event
- `memory/patterns/PATTERNS.jsonl` is append-only; never edit existing lines
- `memory/archive/` is the only place superseded content lives; never hard delete (per D9)
- Irreversible operations require explicit user confirmation
- Treat your own memory as a hint, not a fact (§3.4); verify against actual code before acting
