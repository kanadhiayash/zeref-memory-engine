"""Runtime enforcement for the documentary policy layer.

At v1.0.0 these policies (PRIVACY.md, REDACT.md, SHARING_POLICY.md,
config/PERMISSIONS.md) were parsed as documentation only. This module
turns them into typed runtime inputs consulted by every network-egress
and LLM-egress code path (see ZRF-AUDIT-001, 002, 006, 007, 008).
