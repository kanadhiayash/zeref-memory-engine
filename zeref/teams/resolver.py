"""Resolver — score executable capabilities against a mission seat.

Master plan §8.7 lists 13 factors; every non-observable factor defaults
to a neutral value (0.5) so the resolver stays deterministic even when
recent-success / benchmark rows haven't been populated. Ties broken by
capability_id ascending.

Seat + capability metadata:
- seat.provides[]        — list of capability domains the seat expects
- seat.reasoning_class   — one of fast / balanced / deep / frontier
- capability.provides[]  — from the manifest
- capability.type        — skill / agent / cli / mcp_server / ...
- capability_versions.compatibility — harness compat JSON

Scores are in [0, 1]. A capability that fails a hard filter (lifecycle
not executable, seat requires an independent slot already used, harness
incompatible) is excluded — never silently downweighted.
