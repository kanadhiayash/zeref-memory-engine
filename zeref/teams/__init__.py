"""Team compiler + resolver (vNext PR 7, master plan §9.3).

Given (task_id, mission, policy, active_harness), the compiler:

1. Reads every approved capability from the registry (PR 4).
2. For each mission seat, scores every capability against the seat's
   requirements using the 13 factors in master plan §8.7.
3. Enforces independence constraints (e.g. verifier `independent_from:
   [implementer]`) — self-review is refused, not silently allowed.
4. Persists the compiled plan to `team_runs`, `team_assignments`, and
   `execution_steps` (schemas landed in PR 2).

No supervisor here; PR 8 owns execution.
