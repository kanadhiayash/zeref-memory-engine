"""Context codecs (vNext PR 9, master plan §7).

Codecs translate structured data into a model-facing representation.
TOON is one of several — never canonical. Selection is data-shape +
model-profile driven; benchmark history steers it.

Canonical invariant:

    Codecs are strictly for the *model input* projection.
    They never replace SQLite (canonical state) or JSONL (canonical
    history).
