"""Provider-neutral reasoning classes (vNext ADR-0002).

Core code and canonical schemas never name provider models. Tasks carry a
criticality; criticality resolves to a reasoning class; a provider adapter
(zeref/adapters/providers/) maps the class to a concrete model at the edge.

Hard rules enforced here, not in prose:
- ``frontier`` is reserved for CRITICAL tasks.
- LOW tasks always resolve to ``fast`` — never anything costlier.
