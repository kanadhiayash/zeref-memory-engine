"""Grading rules — deterministic, code-enforced.

The invariant enforced here (PR 10 acceptance gate): review robustness
NEVER upgrades source quality. It can lower the effective grade
(when panel dissent or method uniformity contradicts a confidently
sourced claim), it can add caveats, it can cap final confidence — but
`combine(quality=weak, robustness=strong)` is still `weak`.
