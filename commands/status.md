description: Show current session state without modifying anything. Read-only. Operates over flat memory/ layout per ZEREF_OS §0.

Read-only. Do not write to memory or modify config.

1. Read `config/PROJECT.md` — report project name, privacy mode (from `PRIVACY.md`), model tier (from `config/BUDGET.md`), parent sync status.
2. Read `memory/hot.md` — report 1-line "current context" summary.
3. Read `memory/index.md` — report domain count, last updated.
4. Count entries in `memory/DECISIONS.md`, `memory/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`, `memory/RISKS.md`, `memory/CONFLICTS.md`.
5. Read tail 10 lines of `memory/patterns/PATTERNS.jsonl` — report event types + counts. Report active team pack (if any) from `memory/MEMORY.md` `## Active team` section.
6. List active permission overrides (in-memory, if any) + connector enablement summary from `SHARING_POLICY.md`.
7. Count pending skill drafts in `skills/drafts/`.
8. Output:
   ```
