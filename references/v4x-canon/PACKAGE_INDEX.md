## Reading Order for Claude Code

1. INGEST_PROMPT.md — Copy-paste this first. It tells Claude Code exactly what to do.
2. ZEREF_OS.md — Full behavioral constitution. The source of truth for behavior.
3. AGENTS.md — Harness-agnostic source of truth for all tools.
4. CLAUDE.md — One-line stub (See @AGENTS.md).
5. DECISION_LOG.md — All architectural decisions, rationale, and rejected directions.
6. RESEARCH_RESOURCES.md — All links, sources, community data points.
7. MODEL_DEBATE.md — What each AI model needs from Zeref + ratings table.
8. USE_CASES.md — Six use cases at 110% Zeref capability.
