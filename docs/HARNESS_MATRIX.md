# Harness Matrix — Zeref Memory Engine

Portability evidence per harness. Evidence-state (not ✅ marks) per [ZRF-AUDIT-022] +
D7 (ratified 2026-07-10): only harnesses with a host-observed boot log are `verified`.
Everything else is `documented-only` until a host log ships.

Evidence states:

- **verified** — host executed the boot sequence AND memory-read AND handoff AND privacy-scan
  during a recorded session; log path cited.
- **partially-verified** — one or two of the four stages executed; others documented-only.
- **documented-only** — stubs shipped and CLI wiring exists, but no host log observed.
- **unsupported** — the host cannot boot Zeref reliably; explicit exclusion.
- **blocked** — host unavailable in the audit environment; state unknown.

| Harness | Stub | Boot | Memory read | Tool surface | Handoff | Evidence state | Log reference |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|:---|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` | yes | yes | yes | yes | **verified** | `ZEREF_CONSISTENCY_AUDIT.md` §Verification, private `zeref-operator-records` repo (audit branch `claude/zeref-consistency-audit-ed392b`) |
| Codex | `CODEX.md` | doc | doc | via `python3 -m zeref` | doc | **documented-only** | stubs present; no host log |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/zeref.mdc` | doc | doc | via `python3 -m zeref` | doc | **documented-only** | stubs present; no host log |
| Windsurf | `.windsurfrules` | doc | doc | via `python3 -m zeref` | doc | **documented-only** | stubs present; no host log |
| Aider | `.aider.conf.yml.example` | doc | doc | via `python3 -m zeref` | doc | **documented-only** | stub `.example` only — user must copy to `.aider.conf.yml` |
| Gemini CLI / Antigravity | `GEMINI.md` | doc | doc | via `python3 -m zeref` | doc | **documented-only** | stubs present; no host log |
| Llama family (Ollama, vLLM, Open WebUI) | `LLAMA.md` | doc | doc | via `python3 -m zeref` | doc | **documented-only** | system-prompt wrapper approach; requires host testing |
| Hermes, Amp, Zed, Perplexity | none (reads `AGENTS.md`) | doc | doc | via `python3 -m zeref` | doc | **documented-only** | no dedicated stub |

## Boot-sequence verification (per [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) §0)

Recorded in the Zeref project memory of the harness under `memory/patterns/PATTERNS.jsonl`
as a `harness-boot-verified` event. Fields:

```
{"ts": "...", "harness": "<name>", "version": "<host-version>",
 "steps_verified": ["soul", "project", "hot", "index", "privacy", "redact", "memory", "patterns"],
 "signature": "sha256:<log-hash>"}
```

An entry with all 8 steps + a signed log promotes the harness to `verified`.

## Verification commands (per host)

```bash
# in any harness, from your project root:
python3 scripts/harness-probe.py                 # file-presence check (does not prove boot)
python3 -m zeref status                          # discovery + memory read
python3 -m zeref write-decision \
  --title "Harness smoke test" --why "Verifying boot" \
  --evidence "harness-matrix" --grade medium     # single-writer + scrub + audit log
python3 -m zeref audit-privacy --strict          # policy-vs-enforcement
python3 -m zeref handoff compile                 # cross-model packager
```

The `harness-probe.py` file-presence check alone does NOT constitute a `verified` state
per D7 — a `verified` row requires the four smoke commands executed in the host's
terminal pane, with the PATTERNS.jsonl `harness-boot-verified` event as evidence.

## How to add a new harness

1. Create the stub file (`<HARNESS>.md` or host-specific rule file).
2. Boot the host in a Zeref-initialized project.
3. Run the four smoke commands above.
4. Verify a `harness-boot-verified` event lands in `memory/patterns/PATTERNS.jsonl`.
5. Add the row to this matrix with the log reference.
6. Update `docs/HARNESS_MATRIX.md` in the same PR as the stub file.

## Legacy note

The prior `v1.0.0` matrix used ✅/⚠ marks that were self-attested — this file replaces
that convention with the evidence-state schema described here (per ZRF-AUDIT-022 finding).
