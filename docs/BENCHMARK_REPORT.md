# Internal Quality Axes Report - Zeref Memory Engine

> **Internal quality axes — fixture-based self-checks. NOT external benchmark results.**
> These axes verify local invariants against committed fixtures. They do not measure
> performance on any external dataset and must not be quoted as benchmark scores.
> External-dataset benchmarking lives in [`benchmarks/external/`](../benchmarks/external/README.md);
> no external scores are claimed until full-dataset runs are published.

## Verdict

**PASS** - deterministic internal quality gates passed.

This report is local and deterministic. It does not claim external superiority, production readiness, or a final perfect-score verdict.

The `trust` axis is independently re-graded by the security audit before publication. When the audit score is lower than the deterministic draft, the verified score is the published score.

Lineage axes validate local intake metadata, implementation registries, and guardrails. They are not external-dataset verification of the referenced projects.
