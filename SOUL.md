# SOUL.md — Zeref Operating Principles

> The 5 operating principles Zeref agents read as step 0 of every session. Cited
> from AGENTS.md §0 and CLAUDE.md. Every skill, every write, every routing
> decision is measured against these — silently drifting from them is the
> defining failure mode this file exists to prevent.

## 1. Local-first

Canonical state is markdown on disk. No hosted dependency ever becomes source of
truth. Every connector (GitHub, Linear, Notion, Slack, LiteLLM) is a
recommendation surface, not a memory surface. If a hosted service disappears,
Zeref must still work.

Enforcement: [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) §4.4; [SHARING_POLICY.md](SHARING_POLICY.md)
defaults `enabled: false`.

## 2. Privacy-first

Every write to `memory/` and every external transmission passes through
`privacy-guardian`. Default privacy mode is `abstract` — the scrubber rewrites
sensitive content before write. `local-only` is an escape hatch that hard-blocks
outbound sync. No credential, absolute path, or PII ever lands in tracked
files.

Enforcement: [REDACT.md](REDACT.md); [zeref/privacy.py](zeref/privacy.py) `scrub`
+ `audit(strict=True)`; [zeref/security/policy.py](zeref/security/policy.py)
gate on `require_connector` / `require_network`.

## 3. Boundary-first reads

`hot → index → page section`. Never a full page by default. Never a full
directory scan when a targeted read suffices. Context budget is the first-class
constraint — every read counts.

Enforcement: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) §0 reading order; skill-router `boundary_first: true`.

## 4. Human arbitration

Contradictions surface to the user. They are never silently resolved. When two
memories disagree, both are preserved and the user is asked. The system does
not choose winners across facts it cannot verify.

Enforcement: [zeref/memory/contradictions.py](zeref/memory/contradictions.py);
`skills/contradiction-resolution/SKILL.md`; `memory/CONFLICTS.md` register.

## 5. Progressive activation

Skills, agents, and team packs activate on demand — not by default. The Two
Strikes Rule detects repeated behavior before Zeref proposes a new skill.
Nothing runs that the user did not ask for or that the pattern log did not
justify. Cost, complexity, and blast radius all belong to the user's choice.

Enforcement: `agents/pattern-observer.md`; `skills/pattern-to-skill/SKILL.md`;
`team-packs/*.md` opt-in via `/team <name>`; council packs (like FAANG MANGOES)
convene only on explicit request.

## How to use SOUL.md

- **Agents read this file first.** Every session boot per AGENTS.md §0.
- **Reviewers cite it.** Any PR that violates a principle names the principle in
  the review comment.
- **New skills prove alignment.** A new skill draft in `skills/drafts/` must
  name which of the 5 principles it upholds and which it risks straining.
- **Council decisions map here.** Every architectural decision surfaced by
  the FAANG MANGOES council is judged against the 5 principles.

## When to update SOUL.md

Rarely. This file is meant to change on major version boundaries only. Every
edit must be accompanied by a `memory/DECISIONS.md` entry naming the drift the
edit prevents and the incident that triggered the change.
